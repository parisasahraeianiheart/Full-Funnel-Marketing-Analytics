Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) — Summary of What We Did

Data Preparation
	•	Loaded daily channel-level spend and daily revenue data.
	•	Pivoted data so each day has spend columns for: facebook, search, youtube, email.
	•	Merged the channel spend data with daily revenue to form the MMM dataset.

Adstock Transformation (Carryover Effect)
	•	Implemented geometric adstock to model how ad effects persist across days.
	•	Created new variables like facebook_adstock, search_adstock, etc.
	•	Purpose: simulate memory effect in consumer behavior.
	•	Carryover effect
	•	Lagged impact
	•	Adstock decay

Diminishing Returns (Nonlinear Saturation)
	•	Applied log1p (log(1+x)) transformation to adstock variables.
	•	This models the fact that incremental ROI declines as spend increases.
	•	Created variables like facebook_dr representing diminished-response media inputs.
	•	Saturation
	•	Diminishing returns
	•	Concave response function

OLS Regression Model (Stage 1 MMM)
	•	Built the MMM using statsmodels OLS (Ordinary Least Squares).
	•	Used sm.add_constant() to include intercept (baseline sales).
	•	Extracted:
	•	Coefficients (effect sizes)
	•	p-values (significance)
	•	R² (model fit)
	•	Standard errors, CI, diagnostics
	•	OLS regression
	•	Intercept
	•	Coefficient
	•	Significance
	•	Baseline sales


Channel Contribution Calculation
	•	Multiplied each channel’s:
	•	Coefficient (β) × Transformed spend value
	•	Produced daily incremental revenue contributions like:
	•	facebook_contrib
	•	search_contrib
	•	Summed them to quantify each channel’s total contribution over the period.
	•	Incremental contribution
	•	Channel lift
	•	Attribution via MMM coefficients

ROI Calculation (Return on Investment)
	•	Computed total spend per channel.
	•	Calculated ROI = contribution / spend for each channel.
	•	Interpreted ROI to determine which channels are:
	•	Under-spent
	•	Efficient
	•	Inefficient
	•	Incremental ROI
	•	Marginal ROI
	•	Spend efficiency

Response Curve Construction
	•	Simulated hypothetical spend levels for each channel.
	•	Re-applied adstock + log transform to those values.
	•	Multiplied by channel coefficients to compute predicted revenue.
	•	Graphed response curves (spend → revenue curves).
	•	Response function
	•	Saturation curve
	•	Hypothetical scenarios
	•	Model-based simulation
